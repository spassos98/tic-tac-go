# Tic-Tac-Go

This is my first project using go on my way to learn the language. 

I implemented a tic-tac-toe game which can be played via console with this release [] or with a TUI with this release []. The user is always the player one and the cpu is player two. The cpu decides on a move based on a MinMaxAlgorithm.

## Installation

### Requirements

```Go```

- Clone the repository
- `go mod tidy` to install the dependencies
- go run .
